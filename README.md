# RT-ProjectManager

RT-ProjectManager was an unfinished extension for Request Tracker, which I tried to use back in the day and thought could be a good starting point.

The source doesn't seem to be available for download anywhere, so the initial commits to this repository were synthesized from the posts to the rt-commit mailing list.
